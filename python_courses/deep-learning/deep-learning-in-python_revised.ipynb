    "You're now going to practice calculating slopes. When plotting the mean-squared error loss function against predictions, the slope is 2 * x * (y-xb), or 2 * input_data * error. Note that x and b may have multiple numbers (x is a vector for each data point, and b is a vector).  In this case, the output will also be a vector, which is exactly what you want. You're ready to write the code to calculate this slope while using a single data point. You'll use pre-defined weights called weights as well as data for a single point called input_data.  The actual value of the target you want to predict is stored in target."

However, it's possible to move too far in that direction. So you will want to take a small step in that direction first, using a lower learning rate, and verify that the model is improving.The weights have been pre-loaded as weights, the actual value of the target as target, and the input data as input_data. The predictions from the initial weights are stored as preds."

The input_data, target, and weights have been pre-loaded. This network does not have any hidden layers, and it goes directly from the input (with 3 nodes) to an output node.  Note that weights is a single array.We have also pre-loaded matplotlib.pyplot, and the error history will be plotted after you have done your gradient descent steps."

    "Now you'll get to work with your first model in Keras, and will immediately be able to run more complex neural network models on larger datasets compared to the first two chapters.To start, you'll take the skeleton of a neural network and add a hidden layer and an output layer. You'll then fit that model and see Keras do the optimization so your model continually gets better.As a start, you'll predict workers wages based on characteristics like their industry, education and level of experience.  You can find the dataset in a pandas dataframe called df.  For convenience, everything in df except for the target has been converted to a NumPy matrix called predictors. The target, wage_per_hour, is available as a NumPy matrix called target.For all exercises in this chapter, we've imported the Sequential model constructor, the Dense layer constructor, and pandas."

You'll want the optimization to start from scratch every time you change the learning rate, to give a fair comparison of how each learning rate did in your results. So we have created a function get_new_model() that creates an unoptimized model to optimize."

    "You've seen how to experiment with wider networks. In this exercise, you'll try a deeper network (more hidden layers).  Once again, you have a baseline model called model_1 as a starting point. It has 1 hidden layer, with 50 units. You can see a summary of that model's structure printed out. You will create a similar network with 3 hidden layers (still keeping 50 units in each layer).This will again take a moment to fit both models, so you'll need to wait a few seconds to see the results after you run your code."

    "You've reached the final exercise of the course - you now know everything you need to build an accurate model to recognize handwritten digits! We've already done the basic manipulation of the MNIST dataset shown in the video, so you have X and y loaded and ready to model with. Sequential and Dense from keras are also pre-imported.To add an extra challenge, we've loaded only 2500 images, rather than 60000 which you will see in some published results. Deep learning models perform better with more data, however, they also take longer to train, especially when they start becoming more complex. If you have a computer with a CUDA compatible GPU, you can take advantage of it to improve computation time. If you don't have a GPU, no problem! You can set up a deep learning environment in the cloud that can run your models on a GPU. Here is a blog post by Dan that explains how to do this - check it out after completing this exercise! It is a great next step as you continue your deep learning journey.Ready to take your deep learning to the next level? Check out Advanced Deep Learning with Keras in Python to see how the Keras functional API lets you build domain knowledge to solve new types of problems. Once you know how to use the functional API, take a look at \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Processing\" to learn image-specific applications of Keras."
